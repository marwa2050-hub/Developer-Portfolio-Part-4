Brief Reflection
This portfolio reflects my growth as a frontend developer by showcasing my ability to create accessible, responsive, and animated web applications using React and Framer Motion. I am most proud of the Projects section, where each project includes detailed problem, solution, and outcome explanations along with live demo and code links. It demonstrates my attention to both design and functionality. In the future, I want to enhance this portfolio by adding dynamic content fetching, improving SEO, and integrating more interactive features like dark mode toggle and user authentication. This continuous improvement reflects my commitment to learning and delivering polished user experiences.
